# API REST - Cloud

This API was develop during the Santander Bootcamp Backend Java, presents by DIO, to practice the use of Spring Boot
and also uploading applications to the cloud, using the Railway to host.

It consists in a simulation of a backend of a banking app that must display certain information to the customer,
such account number, card information, news, and another features.

It have been used:
* Java 17
* Intellij IDEA

* Postgres

Based on this activit, I also develop another API which is available at the following repository: https://github.com/Pris-c/hp-characters-age
